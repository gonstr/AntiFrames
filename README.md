## Usage

These Frames are meant to be use as a replacement for the standard Blizz Party and Arena frames. They are specifically for use in Arena. These frames on their own does not have any advanced features like debuff tracking, trinket use, CC tracking, diminishing returns, etc. They do however serve as good base frames when paired with a good WeakAura Arena pack.
